            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>"FoodForNation" is a local hunger relief project operated by a group of volunteers in Bangladesh who are
                passionate about fighting hunger. Our goal is to integrate environmental and social responsibility in
                one objective. We collaborate with strategic partners-including food and non-food corporations-to
                collect food and deliver it to local non-profit partners in need by recovering surplus food from various
                partners, including supermarkets, farms, food retailers, restaurants, catering agencies and even
                rubbish bins. While we assist other non-profits, we also support
                impoverished areas by recycling food waste for reuse.</p><br>

                    hungry.In addition to rescuing people from going hungry,FoodForNation rescues fruits and veggies
                    from going to waste by partnering with local food retailers on donating their surplus produce to our
                    food truck instead.</p>

                <h3>We Promote Food Security</h3>
                <p>Food security does NOT just mean having access to food per se, but also being able to consume and
                    utilize it in a way that ensures mental and physical health. Without good nutrition people cannot
                    realize their potential and make a contribution to society.Because of that reason we have come to
                    ensure food security.</p>
