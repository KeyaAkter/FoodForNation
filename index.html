            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>FoodForNation is a local hunger relief project operated by a group of volunteers in Bangladesh who are
                passionate about fighting hunger. Our goal is to integrate environmental and social responsibility in
                one objective. We collaborate with strategic partners-including food and non-food corporations-to
                collect food and deliver it to local non-profit partners in need by recovering surplus food from events,
                arranging food drives, and fundraiser events. While we assist other non-profits, we also support
                impoverished areas by recycling food waste for reuse.</p><br>
